## 📖 Project Overview
This repository contains an end-to-end data science project that extracts, analyzes, and visualizes personality trait distributions within the Harry Potter universe. The project bridges the gap between unstructured narrative text and interactive 3D analytics, utilizing Transformer-based NLP for data extraction and a combination of PCA and Agglomerative Clustering for personality mapping.

## 🔬 Technical Methodology

### Phase 0: NLP Trait Extraction
The dataset was generated by processing raw character dialogue and narrative descriptions through a Transformer-based regression model (`vladinc/bigfive-regression-model`).

* **Data Engineering:** Implemented custom entity resolution logic to standardize character mentions and aggregate trait scores across the series.
* **Normalization:** Trait scores (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism) were standardized using `StandardScaler` to ensure uniform weighting.

### Phase 1: Feature Decorrelation & Noise Reduction (PCA)
While the dataset consists of only five features, **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** was utilized for:

1.  **Feature Decorrelation:** Psychometric traits often exhibit high multicollinearity. PCA transformed these into linearly uncorrelated principal components, ensuring clustering models weighted underlying variance rather than redundant feature signals.
2.  **Noise Reduction:** The first three principal components capture approximately **97.58%** of the total variance. Focusing on these filters out residual statistical noise and enables a mathematically grounded 3D visualization.



### Phase 2: Clustering Strategy & Optimization
I evaluated two distinct unsupervised learning approaches:

* **K-Means (Benchmarking):** Utilized as a baseline to identify the "Optimal $k$" through Silhouette Analysis and the Elbow Method (SSE).
* **Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (Implementation):** Selected for the final "Similarity Tree." By employing **Cosine Distance**, the model groups characters based on the "shape" of their personality profiles (relative trait ratios) rather than absolute score magnitude.

## 📏 Similarity Metric Duality
This project distinguishes between high-level grouping and individualized matching:

* **Cosine Similarity:** Used for the Hierarchical Tree to identify characters sharing similar personality structures.
* **Euclidean Distance:** Used for the "Character Mirror" matching engine. Euclidean distance is critical here as it respects **Trait Intensity**, ensuring users are matched with a character of similar energy levels.

## 🎨 Application Features

* **The Personality Galaxy:** An interactive 3D Plotly environment mapping characters within the PCA-transformed feature space.
* **The Character Mirror:** A predictive matching engine that identifies a user's statistical "twin" based on 5D Euclidean distance.
* **Hierarchical Similarity Tree:** A dendrogram visualization representing the archetypal relationships between characters.
* **Statistical Challenges:** Includes the "Sorting Hat" game (identifying characters by radar-chart "Shadow Profiles") and "Who am I?" (trait-based deduction).
